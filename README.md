# Rook-move

## Project Description:

The user enters the coordinates of two squares on a chessboard (first the vertical and horizontal of the first square, then the vertical and horizontal of the second square). The chessboard is empty. The program calculates the minimum number of moves a rook needs to go from the first square to the second square and shows these moves using chess notation.
